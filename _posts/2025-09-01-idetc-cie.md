excerpt: SEAD Lab members showcased their latest research at the 2025 ASME IDETC-CIE conference held in Anaheim, California.

This August, SEAD Lab actively contributed to the ASME IDETC-CIE Conference, one of the leading international forums for Design and Computers & Information in Engineering.


Our presentations included:

Jinyang Li & Jie Chen (2025). An Integer Approximation for the Discrete Fourier Transform Matrix for Fast Time-Series Data Analysis.

Jun Li & Jie Chen (2025). Bayesian Hierarchical Models and Neural Networks for Defect-Based Fatigue Prediction in Additive Manufacturing.

Jie Chen, Pengfei Ou, Yuxin Chang, Hengrui Zhang, Xiaoyan Li, Edward Sargent & Wei Chen (2025). Adaptive Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning for Materials Discovery with High-Dimensional Design Inputs.

These talks highlight SEAD Labâ€™s ongoing work at the intersection of machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and engineering design, showcasing both methodological advances and applications in materials and manufacturing.
