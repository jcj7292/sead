# Research

Our research is two-fold: first, integrating engineering analysis and design knowledge into the development of stochastic machine learning (ML) algorithms (**Physics for ML**); and second, harnessing machine learning for the discovery of engineering analysis and design knowledge under uncertainty (**ML for Physics**). Our engineering applications focus on process-structure-property-performance relationships, both static and fatigue, including additive manufacturing, digital twins, and high-throughput materials characterization.

## ML for Physics

### Digital Twin for Monitoring and Control in Additive Manufacturing
Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a disruptive Industry 4.0 technology that offers superior flexibility of manufacturing complex products and reduces energy and material waste. However, AM part quality is highly variable due to inadequate dimensional tolerances, surface roughness, and defects, thereby limiting its broad acceptance. To this end, we develop Digital twin (DT) technology for real-time monitoring and control. This framework dynamically adjusts the AM process parameters based on the non-destructive testing signals (digital-to-physical). Physics-based computational models such as the finite element method and computational fluid dynamics have been widely applied to predict thermal behavior in AM processes. However, they suffer from intensive computational costs, thus are not suitable for applications in online control and iterative design. To enable real-time control in AM, we develop advanced machine learning methods. High-fidelity simulation is used for offline training. Multi-fidelity models are used for online prediction. Meanwhile, both high and low-fidelity models will be updated from the AM experimental data (physical-to-digital). Adaptive sampling approaches are used for both online and offline data collections. In addition, uncertainty will be quantified to develop statistical confidence in the ability to control and monitor the process.
