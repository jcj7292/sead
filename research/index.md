# Research

Our research is two-fold: first, integrating engineering analysis and design knowledge into the development of stochastic machine learning (ML) algorithms (**Physics for ML**); and second, harnessing machine learning for the discovery of engineering analysis and design knowledge under uncertainty (**ML for Physics**). Our engineering applications focus on process-structure-property-performance relationships, both static and fatigue, including additive manufacturing, digital twins, and high-throughput materials characterization.
